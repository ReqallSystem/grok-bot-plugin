# SLEEP — compress project memory

**Goal:** Preserve **knowledge** in a **minimal number of short, non-redundant records**.
User invoked sleep → rewrite and delete are expected. Compression is the point.
Knowledge = decisions, outcomes, constraints, IDs, contracts — not session prose.

Ops: `consolidate` · `split` · `compact` · `skip` · `crosslink` · `promote` · `discard`

Rate-limited ~once per 24h per project. **Modest progress is success**.

Use Reqall MCP tools `upsert_project`, `sleep_candidates`, and `sleep_apply`,
plus `get_record`, `list_records`, `list_links`, `search`, and `upsert_link` for review/verification.

## Decision table

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Server cluster of highly similar resolved/archived | **consolidate** → one terse durable record; **sources deleted** |
| Isolated resolved/archived; durable but verbose | **compact** |
| Isolated resolved/archived; pure noise | **skip** |
| Active/open; 2+ clearly separable topics | **split** (original deleted by apply) |
| Active/open; single topic, already clear | leave (no op) |
| Cross-project pair; same concept, discovery-useful | **crosslink** |
| Cross-project pair; superficial token overlap | omit |
| `work_review`: unique durable information after comparison | **promote** → durable kind(s), then work log deleted |
| `work_review`: no unique durable information after comparison | **discard** only after preserving useful relationships |
| Candidate unclear / not obvious | **omit this pass** |

`promote` / `discard` apply only to `kind: work`. Never emit `work` from
consolidate/split. Prefer `info` / `arch` / `todo` / `issue` when promoting.

## WORK review policy

Use host equivalents of the tool names below, and only advertised operations/kinds.
If the required reads or operations are unavailable, omit the candidate this pass.

1. Read each WORK log with `get_record`, paginate incoming/outgoing `list_links`,
   and read linked ARCH/SPEC and other durable records. Use project-scoped `search`
   to find existing intent and knowledge, especially when links are missing.
2. **Alignment is not redundancy.** Preserve unique implementation constraints,
   regression fixes, test evidence, outcomes, and remaining limitations even when
   the work followed its spec. Use `promote` into appropriate durable kinds.
3. **Discard only after comparison shows no unique durable information.** Identify
   the surviving records that cover useful content; a knowledge-free log needs none.
   Preserve useful relationships on durable records before discarding: `discard`
   deletes the log's links too. If coverage or relationship meaning is unclear, omit.
4. Preserve an evidence-backed unresolved deviation as a linked `issue`, separating
   expected behavior, observed behavior, and uncertainty about the cause. The
   implementation or the spec may be wrong. Do not automatically rewrite ARCH/SPEC.
5. **Missing links do not prove new requirements.** Reuse intent found by search.
   Promote a novel fact to `info` (or another fitting durable kind); use `spec` only
   for confirmed requirements, never to turn an unapproved proposal into a decision.
6. **Leave ambiguous cases unchanged.** Preserve historical qualifications: dated
   test results and past PR state are not current deployment/runtime guarantees.
7. Before apply, snapshot source records/links and re-read touched records for drift.
   After apply, inspect every result, read back outputs and surviving links, and
   verify deleted sources return structured not-found. Link a new issue to its
   relevant intent with `upsert_link` if needed, then verify. Repair only confirmed
   missing edges. Never replay a destructive batch after an ambiguous response.

## Steps

1. **Project** — Preserve the explicit SLEEP argument first; otherwise
   reuse the host binding or apply the Project naming policy below.
   Call `upsert_project` with that exact name → `project_id`.
2. **Candidates** — `sleep_candidates` with `project_id`. If rate-limited,
   report next eligible time and stop.
3. **Summary** — counts: consolidate, compact/skip, split, crosslink,
   work_review. Empty → "No eligible candidates this pass."
4. **Select ops** — decision table and WORK review policy above. Bodies: terse, non-redundant.
   - **consolidate** — `kind: "arch"`, `status: "resolved"`; best title; keep knowledge from all members; wording is disposable.
   - **compact** — same id; leaner form.
   - **split** — focused sub-records; kind/status fit each topic (usually match original).
   - **crosslink** — only when useful for discovery.
   - **promote** / **discard** — work logs only. Preserve unique knowledge/evidence;
     discard only after the comparison and relationship checks above.
5. **Apply** — one `sleep_apply` with the batch. No per-op confirmation.
6. **Verify** — inspect every apply result for partial failures; do not
   retry the whole destructive batch after an ambiguous response.
7. **Report** — consolidated / compacted / split / crosslinked / skipped /
   promoted / discarded / errors. If candidates were capped: note to run again later.

## Rules

- Knowledge ≠ wording. Prose is disposable; durable facts are not.
- **consolidate always deletes sources**. **promote** and **discard** delete
  the work log.
- Do not ask whether rewrite/delete is OK — user ran sleep.
- Unclear candidate → omit; do not invent merges or splits.
- Server authorization does not replace client judgment or record/link readback.
- Never persist or rewrite secrets into records.

## Project naming policy

Use a host-supplied binding as authoritative: reuse its exact project name through recall, work, persistence, and verification. Do not independently rediscover it in later steps. Preserve deliberate operation arguments (including a manual SLEEP target) and supported session selections; these instructions do not install automatic hooks or invent host settings. If no binding exists, discover locally using the policy below. If required local information is unavailable, ask for an explicit project instead of guessing; do not write to an invented project.

Canonical contract: https://github.com/ReqallSystem/plugins/blob/main/doc/PROJECT_NAMING.md
The following embedded policy works offline.

Reqall project names must agree across clients. This is client-side discovery, not
server-side filesystem inspection. Do not migrate or rename existing records as a
side effect of discovery. Reuse the exact project bound by the host's context hook
through recall, work, persistence, and verification.

## Precedence

Preserve deliberate operation arguments (for example a SLEEP target) and supported
session selections. For automatic discovery use the first available source:

1. Nonempty, trimmed `REQALL_PROJECT_NAME`, or an existing host-scoped project
   setting. Environment wins over settings. Do not invent a new settings mechanism
   in hosts that have none.
2. Actual network Git `origin`, normalized as below.
3. An explicitly labelled `project_name` or `project` selection in the user's
   prompt, or the host's retained session selection. Labels accept `:` or `=` and
   unquoted, single-quoted, double-quoted, or backtick-quoted values. Strip sentence
   punctuation only from unquoted values. Incidental paths, URLs, quoted examples
   in synthetic notifications, and arbitrary slash tokens are not a selection.
4. Nearest valid ancestor `.reqall.yml` or `.reqall.yaml` identity.
5. Nearest valid package identity: `package.json`, `go.mod`, then `Cargo.toml` at
   each directory, before moving to its parent.
6. Exact POSIX-style cwd-relative path within a known workspace root.
7. Reserved `.machine/<short-lower-hostname>/<os-user>`.

Use OS account identity, not `USER`/`USERNAME` environment hints. A nonempty
`REQALL_MACHINE_NAME` replaces the whole hostname segment; sanitize and lowercase
it, but retain dots in this deliberate override. Account-wide preferences may be
routed deliberately to `.user`. Do not use an unconstrained cwd basename.

Explicit names are identifiers, not metadata to repair: preserve them apart from
outer whitespace. The automatic metadata/path checks below do not silently rewrite
manually selected historical names.

## Git compatibility

Accept network HTTP(S), SSH, and Git URLs and SCP-style remotes. Remove trailing
slashes and the terminal `.git` suffix. Retain the final two path segments, e.g.
`https://github.com/acme/widgets.git` becomes `acme/widgets`.

This intentionally retains the existing server/client convention for nested Git
namespaces: `https://gitlab.com/group/sub/repo.git` becomes `sub/repo`. Keeping the
whole namespace requires a separate identity/migration decision; this alignment
must not silently fork existing memory. Local POSIX/Windows paths and `file:`
remotes are not portable naming sources and fall through to local metadata.

## Portable metadata

Read regular, UTF-8 files of at most 64 KiB. Unreadable, oversized, malformed,
unsupported, and non-string values are skipped without crashing. Search nearest
valid ancestors, stopping at a known containing workspace root (inclusive), or at
the filesystem root when no containing workspace boundary is known.

Automatic names use ASCII letters/digits, `_`, `-`, and `.` within slash-separated
segments. Reject absolute POSIX, drive, UNC, backslash, tilde, empty, `.` and `..`
segments before normalization. A value outside this grammar is skipped, never
rewritten into a valid name; discovery continues with the next source. Never strip a leading slash to make a path appear
portable. Explicit metadata named `src` or `work` is valid; a directory-noise
blacklist must not override intentional metadata.

### Reqall YAML

Use a simple top-level string scalar:

```yaml
project: acme/notes
```

`name` is accepted as an alias; a valid `project` takes precedence. At a directory,
`.reqall.yml` takes precedence over `.reqall.yaml`. Matching single/double quotes
and trailing comments are supported; plain boolean/null/numeric values are not
string identities. Nested mappings, aliases, multiline scalars, and other complex
YAML are not supported. Ambiguous duplicate keys and malformed quoting are rejected.

### Package declarations

- `package.json`: a string `name`. Only a valid npm scoped identity removes one
  leading `@`: `@acme/widgets` becomes `acme/widgets`. Numbers are not coerced.
- `go.mod`: the complete declared `module`, preserving domain, nested path, and
  major-version suffix, e.g. `example.com/acme/widgets/v2`. Comments before the
  declaration are allowed. An empty file is not an error.
- `Cargo.toml`: a simple quoted `name` inside `[package]`, never a `[[bin]]` or
  dependency name. This is a constrained declaration reader, not a full TOML parser.

## Workspace-relative fallback

`REQALL_WORKSPACE_ROOT` supplies the root; relative values are resolved from cwd,
and `~/` uses the current home. Otherwise use the nearest ancestor regular
`.reqall-workspace` marker file. The setting is read from the process environment
when no explicit environment mapping is supplied.

Resolve filesystem paths before containment checks so symlinks cannot escape the
workspace. An invalid or non-containing explicit root does not silently select a
marker instead. Cwd equal to the root produces no relative identity. Preserve all
relative segments, including `src` or `work`; dropping them can merge unrelated
projects. A plain folder without a known root still falls back to machine memory.
